# HSHB OSN WebExtension

A WebExtension for the OpenSpaceNotifier of the Hackerspace Bremen e.V.

# Developed by

- [ccoors](https://www.ccoors.de/)

# Why?

The [original WebExtension](https://github.com/HackerspaceBremen/osn_chrome_ext) only works in Google Chrome, this Extension works in

- Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/hshb-openspacenotifier/)
- Chromium
- Google Chrome

Not officially supported (because [the WebExtension Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) only unofficially supports them) is Opera and the Vivaldi Browser, although they appear to work.

MS Edge is not supported. Might change if [this issue](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill/issues/3) is  resolved.
